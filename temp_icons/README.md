# Temporary Icons

This directory contains icon source files and work-in-progress assets.

**Important**: To avoid build errors, do not duplicate app icon assets that already exist in the main Assets.xcassets folder.

## Icon Assets
The app's official icons are stored in the main asset catalog:
`/stash/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

## Workflow
1. Create or modify icon designs in this directory
2. When finalized, move them to the main asset catalog
3. Update the Contents.json file in the main asset catalog as needed
